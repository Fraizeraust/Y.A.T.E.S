# Y.A.T.E.S

[Y.A.T.E.S](http://www.thomasyates.nl/docs) is a Lua administration tool created for the game Counter-Strike 2D. It focuses mainly on the task to help server owners to administrate their server, it also provides every source to build upon without (hopefully) breaking it. The most important thing that makes Y.A.T.E.S stand out is the fact that every player or group data can be modified in-game and each player or group may also be given individual rights dynamically. Another important feature is the ability to create plugins and have them work together without changing anything. Simply drop them into the plugins folder and you're done!

##### Wha! You're here too soon!
